To show step by step, set useGUI to true (much faster with this off)
To refresh arrows at the end of every generation, set showArrows to true
To raise the number of runs, change the value of runs.
To raise the number of times to iterate run times, raise the value of iterations.

GUI: Black squares are walls, blue is player, yellow is reward, green is player on reward
Arrows will appear at end of every simulation (be default) to show highest action value for each square.

Defaults to showing step by step and refreshing arrows after every generation.
